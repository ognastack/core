# OGNA Backend Stack

This project is a **microservices backend architecture** using **Kong**, **GoTrue (Supabase Auth)**, **FastAPI**, **PostgREST**, and **Postgres**, with JWT authentication and rate-limiting for secure and scalable APIs.

## Overview

This backend stack provides:

- Centralized **API gateway** using Kong
- Authentication and JWT issuance via **GoTrue**
- Business logic through **FastAPI**
- Database-level REST APIs and RPCs via **PostgREST**
- **Postgres** as the main database
- **Rate limiting** per service to protect APIs
- Declarative configuration for Kong and JWT consumers

- All `/api` requests → FastAPI (JWT protected)
- All `/rpc` requests → PostgREST (JWT protected)
- `/auth` requests → GoTrue (signup/login, public)
- Kong handles routing, JWT validation, and rate limiting

## Pluggable Backend Service

This stack is designed to allow **any backend service** to be integrated seamlessly.

### How it works

- The backend must run as a **Docker container**.
- You only need to **replace the Docker image** in the `docker-compose.yml`.
- Kong will route requests to `/api/*` automatically, and JWT validation will still apply.

### Example: Adding a Custom Backend

```yaml
api:
  image: ogna-py-appi:dev # Replace this with your backend image
  container_name: api
  restart: unless-stopped
  depends_on:
    ogna-database:
      condition: service_healthy
    kong-cp:
      condition: service_healthy
  expose:
    - "8000" # The port your backend listens on
  networks:
    - ogna
```

### Notes

- Your backend must **listen on a port** internally (exposed via Docker).
- Kong expects the backend to serve under `/api/*`.
- All JWT authentication, rate limiting, and routing are handled automatically by Kong.
- You can change the image tag to switch environments (e.g., `my-backend:latest` or `my-backend:v1.2.3`).

---

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo-folder>
```

2. Create `.env` files:

- `gotrue.env` → GoTrue environment variables
- `secrets.env` → Postgres username/password

3. Ensure migrations are in `./migrations` folder for Flyway and Postgres initialization

---

## Running the Stack

Start all services with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Check logs for Kong, FastAPI, or PostgREST:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f kong-cp
docker-compose logs -f postgrest
```

Stop the stack:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Endpoints

| Route    | Service   | Description                    | JWT Required |
| -------- | --------- | ------------------------------ | ------------ |
| `/auth`  | GoTrue    | Signup, login, user management | No           |
| `/api/*` | FastAPI   | Application backend endpoints  | Yes          |
| `/rpc/*` | PostgREST | Database RPC endpoints         | Yes          |

---

## Configuration

- **Kong** is configured declaratively in `config/kong.yaml`
- **JWT validation** checks token expiration; `iss` and `aud` verification can be skipped for dev
- **Rate limiting** is applied per service in Kong
- **PostgREST** uses pinned version `11.2.0`
- **GoTrue** uses `GOTRUE_SITE_URL` and `GOTRUE_JWT_AUD` for JWT claims
- Any backend service can be swapped by changing the Docker image under the `api` service
